# JubsTetris
I've always used to love playing tetris as a kid, so I decided to make my own version of tetris using vanila javascript.

A functioning Tetris game with a scoring system. All the blocks are in a shade of green, and the canvas is also much wider but shorter than the traditional Tetris game.

I wrote this in JS
