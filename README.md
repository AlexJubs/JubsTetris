# JubsTetris
I've always used to love playing tetris as a kid, so I decided to make my own version of tetris using vanila javascript.

JubsTetris is a Tetris game but all the blocks are in a shade of green. A unique characteristic of JubsTetris is that the canvas is also much wider but shorter than the tradtional tetris game.
